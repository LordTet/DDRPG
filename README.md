# ABOUT
Some weird RPG + DDR clone mixture that i had the idea for and decided to put at least a little work into.
Additionally, i'm using it to learn C# and the Duality engine. Don't expect constant updates or anything, you'll be dissapointed.

## USAGE
It'll probably work if you download the zip and extract the contents into a clean duality install. Duality can be found [here](https://duality.adamslair.net/)
