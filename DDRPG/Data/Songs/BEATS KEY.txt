The following is the syntax and formatting of a beats file. Each file must be in a folder of its own in the Songs
directory, accompanied by a meta.smta file. The meta file formatting can be found in the Songs folder aswell.

 = Rest (No number, blank line. Note that any character that is invalid will be read as this)

8 = up
2 = down
4 = left
6 = right

7 = Up + Left
9 = Up + Right
1 = Down + Left
3 = Down + Right
5 = Up + Down
0 = Left + Right

Tip: Each beat ID is relative to its location on a standard number pad.
8 is up because it is the top number on the pad, and 7 is up + right because it is the top right number.
5 and 0 are U+D and L+R due to limitations of the organization.


For holdables, Specify the amount of beats the hold lasts (Not yet implemented)

EX:
8
8
2
2
4
6
4
6

Translates to:
Up up down down left right left right, in order.
